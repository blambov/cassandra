/**
 * A simplified version of Trie used for sets (whose ultimate function is to intersect a Trie).
 *
 * Sets cannot be asynchronous and support a special value to denote a branch is fully included in the set,
 * which is used to speed up intersections.
 *
 * Like Trie nodes, set nodes are stateful and not thread-safe. If the consumer can use multiple threads when accessing
 * a node (e.g. with asynchronous trie walks), it must enforce a happens-before relationship between calls to the
 * methods of a node.
